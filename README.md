# powerDatabase

Todo: 
- create directories for each schema
- check rights and ownership
- correctly define foreign keys and cascading properties
- check if create statement for timescaledb tables needs anything additional
- check if Italian regions (regions in general) need validity dates (when created, when cease to exist)
