# powerDatabase

Todo: 
- check rights and ownership
- correctly define foreign keys and cascading properties
- check if create statement for timescaledb tables needs anything additional
- check if Italian regions (regions in general) need validity dates (when created, when cease to exist)

Ensure pqsl is installed
Have psql installed: 
brew update
brew install libpq
brew link --force libpq
then add it to your path, something such as (might vary on your system)
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/libpq/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

psql should be working from command line

Have .pgpass and .env in working dir
Create a .pgpass in your homedirectory. 
The .pgpass file is a plain text file that contains one or more lines with the following format:

hostname:port:database:username:password
In this format:
- hostname: This is the hostname of the server where the PostgreSQL server is running.
- port: This is the port on which the PostgreSQL server is listening.
- database: This is the database to which you want to connect.
- username: This is the username that you want to use to connect to the database.
- password: This is the password of the username.
Each line in the .pgpass file represents connection information for a specific database.
The fields are separated by a colon (:) and can be replaced with an asterisk * as a wildcard to match any value.
The psql reads the password file and uses the first matching. Therefore, itâ€™s important to order the entries with more specific information first, followed by more general wildcard entries, to ensure the proper behavior.
Example: localhost:5432:*:postgres:moreSecure
